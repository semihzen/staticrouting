# Static Routes

### In this project, I created a topology using a static routing structure. In this topology, I manually assigned routes to each port on my router, allowing the end device to ping another end device, which is a server, and to access the website cisco.com. Through this project, I learned the fundamentals of static routing and its purpose. It is a functional structure for small-scale networks like mine, but I realized that it creates a significant workload in larger networks.
